```sh
function volatility() {
  docker run --rm --user=$(id -u):$(id -g) -v "$(pwd)":/dumps:ro,Z -ti phocean/volatility $@
}
#This is a Docker command that runs a container using the image "phocean/volatility". The container is run in interactive mode (-ti) and with the "--rm" flag, which means that it will be removed once it is stopped. 

#The command also includes options to set the user and group IDs of the container to match those of the current user (via the "id -u" and "id -g" commands), and to mount the current working directory as read-only inside the container (via the "-v" flag). The "Z" option indicates that the SELinux security context should be preserved when mounting the directory.

#Finally, the "$@" at the end of the command passes any additional arguments or commands to the container.
