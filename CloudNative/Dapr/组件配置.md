# 组件配置



## 可访问性

A namespaced component is only accessible to applications running in the same namespace. If your Dapr application fails to load a component, make sure that the application namespace matches the component namespace. This can be especially tricky in self-hosted mode where the application namespace is stored in a NAMESPACE environment variable.

## HTTPS

If you leave the Configure for HTTPS checkbox checked, the generated ASP.NET Core API project includes middleware to redirect client requests to the HTTPS endpoint. This breaks communication between the Dapr sidecar and your application, unless you explicitly configure the use of HTTPS when running your Dapr application. To enable the Dapr sidecar to communicate over HTTPS, include the `--app-ssl` flag in the Dapr command to start the application. Also specify the HTTPS port using the `--app-port` parameter. The remainder of this walkthrough uses plain HTTP communication between the sidecar and the application, and requires you to clear the Configure for HTTPS checkbox.

## 状态存储

Care must be taken to always pass an explicit app-id parameter when consuming the state management building block. The block uses the application id value as a prefix for its state key for each key/value pair. If the application id changes, you can no longer access the previously stored state.
